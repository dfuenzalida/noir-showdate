# Showdate

A simple mysql webapp written in Noir and Korma, ready to be deployed on Tomcat as a WAR file.
The `web.xml` file is autogenerated from the `:ring` configuration on project.clj

## Run on development mode

```bash
lein deps
lein run
```

## To package as a WAR file

```bash
lein clean
lein ring uberwar showdate.war
```

Then copy the generated WAR file from the `target/` dir to Tomcat's webapps folder
